    <h2> <p>Low Porosity: Cuticles are tightly packed and flat. Hair resists moisture but retains it well once absorbed.
Medium Porosity: Cuticles are less tightly bound. Hair easily absorbs and retains moisture.
High Porosity: Cuticles are raised or damaged. Hair absorbs moisture quickly but loses it just as fast.
How to Test Your Hair Porosity
Take a clean strand of hair and drop it into a glass of water.
If it floats: Your hair likely has low porosity.
If it sinks slowly: Your hair likely has medium porosity.
If it sinks quickly: Your hair likely has high porosity.
