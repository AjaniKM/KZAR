        <p>Understanding Hair Porosity</p>
    </header>
    <main>
        <h2>What is Hair Porosity?</h2>
        <p>
            Hair porosity refers to your hair's ability to absorb and retain moisture. It is determined by the structure of your hair cuticle, which affects how easily moisture and oils pass in and out of your hair.
        </p>
        <h2>Types of Hair Porosity</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Low Porosity:</strong> Cuticles are tightly packed and flat. Hair resists moisture but retains it well once absorbed.</li>
            <li><strong>Medium Porosity:</strong> Cuticles are less tightly bound. Hair easily absorbs and retains moisture.</li>
            <li><strong>High Porosity:</strong> Cuticles are raised or damaged. Hair absorbs moisture quickly but loses it just as fast.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How to Test Your Hair Porosity</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Take a clean strand of hair and drop it into a glass of water.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>If it floats:</strong> Your hair likely has low porosity.<br>
                <strong>If it sinks slowly:</strong> Your hair likely has medium porosity.<br>
                <strong>If it sinks quickly:</strong> Your hair likely has high porosity.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Tips for Each Porosity Type</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Low Porosity:</strong> Use lightweight products and apply heat when deep conditioning.</li>
            <li><strong>Medium Porosity:</strong> Maintain a balanced routine with regular conditioning.</li>
            <li><strong>High Porosity:</strong> Use heavier creams and oils, and avoid excessive heat styling.</li>
        </ul>
